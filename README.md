# Parking Lot Management System

This is a C# console-based application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It simulates basic parking lot operations such as:
- Parking vehicles
- Removing vehicles
- Viewing parked vehicles
- Updating vehicle numbers with proper validations

The system automatically calculates parking fees based on the vehicle’s entry and exit time.
